/**
 * Re-reads the caller's role and token version from the database.
 *
 * A signed JWT carries the role, so without this the API would honour a
 * role for the token's remaining lifetime even after the account was
 * demoted -- the window in which a removed authority can still moderate.
 * Privileged routes therefore pay one indexed read to confirm the claim
 * against stored state, and `request.auth.role` is replaced with the
 * stored value so everything downstream authorises on fact, not claim.
 *
 * `tokenVersion` is the revocation lever: incrementing a user's
 * `tokenVersion` invalidates every token already issued to them without
 * waiting for expiry. Ordinary citizen requests keep the stateless path.
