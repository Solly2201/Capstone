"""Evaluation-label integrity.

The labelled query sets are the project's only measurement of whether
the legal-answer pipeline is getting better or worse, so a wrong label
is worse than a wrong answer: it hides the wrong answer. Three labels
were reconciled when the RTI Act was ingested and the child-safety
emergency route was added, and these tests pin down both the shape that
makes such a reconciliation auditable and the harness behaviour that
makes a safety-routing expectation real rather than decorative.

Deliberately index-free -- these read the label files and exercise the
harness's own logic with a stub, so they run on a clean checkout and in
CI where no index has been built.
