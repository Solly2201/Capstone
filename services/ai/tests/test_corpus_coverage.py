"""Corpus-coverage guard tests: legal questions about un-ingested Acts.

Deterministic pattern matching only -- no LLM, no ML classifier, run
before retrieval, same standing decision as app.safety.risk and
app.safety.topic_relevance (see docs/PROJECT_STATE.md).

This guard is the narrow fix for a measured failure class: the 313-query
citizen-language evaluation found hybrid retrieval answering 5 of 10
`insufficient_evidence` queries confidently from the wrong Act, because a
legal question about an Act the corpus lacks shares real legal
vocabulary with real legal content and clears the dense-score floor.
The tests below lock in both halves of that fix -- it must catch the
demonstrated failures, and it must not block anything the corpus can
actually answer.
