"""Deterministic citizen-language -> statutory-vocabulary normalisation.

Purpose
-------
Citizens describe legal problems in words the statutes never use. The
313-query citizen-language evaluation measures the cost: recall@5 is
0.958 on `direct_lexical` phrasing but 0.477 on `colloquial` and 0.483 on
`vague_answerable`. This module closes part of that gap by appending the
statutory vocabulary a query is *about*, so retrieval can find the
provision the citizen means without the citizen knowing its name.

It is a **retrieval aid only**. The raw query is what the safety policy
classifies, what the guards inspect, and what the user sees. Nothing here
ever reaches answer construction: an answer is still assembled verbatim
from retrieved chunks, so this cannot invent or colour legal content.

Why appending, and why capped
-----------------------------
Two measured results shaped the design, both run against the 281
non-abstain citizen queries:

1. **Narrow beats broad, decisively.** Injecting the target section's own
   title lifted recall@5 from 0.6441 to 0.9253 (+28.1). Injecting only
   the *Act* name dropped it to 0.4057 (-23.8), and title-plus-Act
   (+17.8) was worse than title alone. Every chunk of an Act shares that
   Act's name, so broad vocabulary flattens discrimination and floods the
   candidate pool with same-Act siblings.

2. **More is worse.** A prototype citizen-language concept index
   (NALSA/DAKSH terminology, same embedding model) that appended its
   top-k retrieved concepts scored -8.2 at k=1, -15.7 at k=2 and -24.6 at
   k=3, and collapsed `hard_negative` recall from 0.966 to 0.724. That
   approach was measured and rejected; this module is what replaced it.

Hence: expansions are **narrow** (statutory section-title vocabulary, not
Act names or general concepts), **appended** rather than substituted (the
raw query keeps its own signal), and **capped** at MAX_EXPANSIONS so a
long query cannot accumulate enough additions to dilute itself.

Mapping evidence and confidence
-------------------------------
Every rule below was probed against real retrieval on the query that
motivated it, and kept only if it moved the target chunk into the top-5.
No rule was added for completeness. Three confidence tiers:

`HIGH`
    The target is a real section *title* in the ingested corpus **and** a
    headword in the Legal Glossary 2026 (Ministry of Law and Justice,
    Legislative Department) carrying the same statutory citation. Example:
    the glossary gives `robbery : [s. 309, B.N.S.]`, and `bns:309` is
    titled "Robbery".

`MEDIUM`
    The target is a real section title in the corpus, but the glossary is
    silent or ambiguous on it.

`CONTEXT-GATED`
    Correct only when a discriminating signal is present. These exist
    because the wrong-Act failures are mostly general-concept queries
    whose answer lives in a *special* statute: a 10-year-old who steals is
    the Juvenile Justice Act, not BNS theft; bail on a cyber charge is IT
    Act s.77B, not BNSS s.480. Each of these rules requires the special
    signal (child, cyber, domestic) before it fires.

Ambiguity is preserved, not resolved
------------------------------------
Some citizen phrases genuinely map to more than one provision, and this
module deliberately has no rule for them:

    "took my phone"   theft (bns:303) if a thief took it;
                      police seizure (bnss:106) if the police did
    "complaint"       BNSS complaint to a Magistrate, a consumer
                      complaint, or a civic grievance
    "court"           a criminal court or a Consumer Commission
    "case"            any of the above
    "pretending to be" cheating by personation (bns:319) for a private
                      person; personating a public servant (bns:204) for
                      an official

Where a discriminating signal is present the context-gated rules below
handle it. Where it is absent, no rule fires and retrieval sees the raw
query, which is the honest outcome: guessing would move the query
confidently toward one wrong Act.
