"""Deterministic guard for legal topics this corpus does not contain.

Runs BEFORE retrieval in `app.generation.pipeline.handle_legal_query`,
immediately after `app.safety.topic_relevance`. Rule-based only, by
design -- no ML/LLM classifier, matching this project's standing
decision that the legal-answer pipeline never uses generation and that
gating stays deterministic (see docs/PROJECT_STATE.md).

Why this is a separate guard from `topic_relevance.py`
------------------------------------------------------
`topic_relevance.py` answers "is this a legal question at all?" and
redirects non-legal subjects (income tax filing, driving licences,
recipes) to a government-services portal. This module answers a
different question: "this *is* a legal question, in this service's own
subject area -- but is the Act it asks about actually in the corpus?"
The two need different user-facing messages. Telling someone with a
POCSO question to try india.gov.in would be unhelpful and slightly
insulting; telling them plainly that this service only holds nine
specific India Code sources, and that theirs is not one of them, is
honest and actionable.

The gap this closes
-------------------
The 313-query citizen-language evaluation added an
`insufficient_evidence` category: legal questions about Acts the corpus
genuinely does not contain. Hybrid retrieval abstained correctly on
20/22 non-legal `out_of_domain` queries but on only 5/10 of these,
because a legal question about an un-ingested Act shares real legal
vocabulary with real legal content and therefore lands in the same
dense-score band as a genuine match. A bounded score cannot separate
"the right Act, weakly matched" from "the wrong Act, strongly matched on
shared legal vocabulary" -- the identical reasoning that produced
`topic_relevance.py`, one level harder. Measured failures this guard
exists to fix (each answered confidently from the wrong Act):

| Query | Was answered from | Actually governed by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| "what is the penalty for drunk driving" | `bns:355` (misconduct in public by a drunken person) | Motor Vehicles Act |
| "how do I get a divorce in india" | `bnss:219` (prosecution for offences against marriage) | matrimonial law |
| "what does the law against caste-based atrocities cover" | `constitution:16` (equality of opportunity) | SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act |
| "what is the punishment under the POCSO act" | `bns:198` (public servant disobeying law) | POCSO |
| "what are the court fees for filing a civil suit" | `bnss:400` (costs in non-cognizable cases) | Court Fees Act / CPC |

Named subjects versus described subjects
----------------------------------------
The table above is handled by `_CATEGORY_PATTERNS`: the query *names*
the un-ingested Act or its distinctive subject, so one phrase catches
it. An earlier revision of this docstring recorded the harder case as
unclosable without a semantic classifier:

    A query that describes an un-ingested Act's subject *without naming
    it* cannot be caught by a phrase guard at all.

That was measured and found wrong, and `_COMPOSED_RULES` now closes it.
A 24-question probe of out-of-corpus subjects showed 14 answered
confidently from unrelated Acts, all in two domains where citizens
almost never use the statutory name:

| Query | Was answered from | Actually governed by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| "how do I get information from a government department" | `bsa:` unpublished official records | RTI Act 2005 |
| "who is a public information officer" | BNSS / BSA | RTI Act 2005 |
| "can I appeal if my information request is refused" | BNSS / CPA 2019 | RTI Act 2005 |
| "a government officer is demanding a bribe to process my file" | BNSS police investigation / PWDVA | Prevention of Corruption Act 1988 |
| "where do I report bribery by a clerk" | BNSS / BNS / BSA | Prevention of Corruption Act 1988 |

The `bsa` answer is the reason this mattered enough to fix: the section
on *unpublished official records* tells a citizen they cannot obtain
official records, which is the exact opposite of the entitlement they
were asking about.

The evaluation set's own `h286` -- "how do I file an application for
information from a government office", written specifically so that it
"cannot be matched lexically" -- was the single remaining `false_answer`
on the 313-query citizen-language set at the time, and now abstains.

What makes these catchable deterministically is that neither domain is
identified by a single word -- "information", "officer", "records" and
"money" are all ordinary corpus vocabulary -- but each is identified
reliably by a *co-occurrence of concepts*: an access verb applied to an
administrative record held by a government body; or an illicit payment
attached to a public official. That is the same SUBJECT x FRAME
composition `app/safety/risk.py` already uses to grade severity without
a keyword blacklist, applied to coverage instead of severity. No model,
no embedding, no threshold -- every decision traces to a named concept
group and is reportable as one.

Scope discipline
----------------
This is emphatically NOT a list of every Indian Act. It carries one
entry per *demonstrated* evaluation failure, and nothing else. Several
other un-ingested subjects in the same eval category (rent control,
minimum wages, stamp duty, arbitration, labour notice periods) are
deliberately absent: the confidence gate already abstains correctly on
them, so adding patterns would be speculative rather than
evidence-driven. The same probe re-confirmed this -- all seven labour
and civic-service questions in it abstained correctly with no guard at
all, so no labour or municipal-services rule was written. If a future
confidence-threshold change turns any of them into a false answer, add
it then -- same "curated dict, extend only when evaluation names a
specific gap" rule as `topic_relevance.py`, `query_expand.py`'s
abbreviation dict, and `chunk.py`'s `_KNOWN_ARTICLE_TITLES`.

Every pattern below was checked against the actual indexed corpus text
before being added, because several obvious-looking discriminators are
unsafe:

- bare "divorce" appears in `bnss:144`/`bnss:146` (maintenance for a
  divorced woman), `bsa:44` and `jj2015:45` -- all genuinely answerable,
  so only divorce *procedure* phrasings are matched.
- bare "drunk" is the literal subject of `bns:303`'s neighbour
  `bns:355` ("Misconduct in public by a drunken person"), so only
  drunk-*driving* phrasings are matched.
- bare "scheduled caste" appears in `constitution:15`, `constitution:16`,
  `constitution:46` and `lsa:12`, so the SC/ST entry keys off
  "atrocities" (zero occurrences anywhere in the corpus) and the Act's
  own name instead.
- bare "court fee" appears in `lsa:21` (court-fee refund on a Lok Adalat
  award), which is a real answerable question, so only
  filing-cost phrasings are matched.
- bare "bribe" is **in the corpus four times and answerably so**: BNS
  punishes electoral bribery (gratification to induce an electoral
  right, including "bribery by treating"), BNS punishes taking
  gratification to screen an offender or to help recover stolen
  property, and BSA lets a witness's credit be impeached by proof of
  bribery. What is absent is the citizen's actual question -- a public
  servant demanding payment to do their job, which the Prevention of
  Corruption Act 1988 governs. The corruption rule therefore requires a
  public-official concept *and* stands down whenever the electoral,
  witness or offence-screening context that the corpus does cover is
  present.
- bare "copy of" and bare "information" are heavily corpus-covered:
  BNSS gives the informant a free copy of the FIR and the accused
  copies of the police report, judgments are supplied as certified
  copies, the Constitution and BNSS require grounds of arrest to be
  communicated, and CPA 2019 gives consumers a right to be informed.
  The information-access rule therefore stands down on any
  court/police/case/consumer context.

Known accepted limitations
--------------------------
- POCSO is cited by name inside `bnss:366`, `bnss:397` and `jj2015:2`
  as a cross-reference, so a narrow query like "are POCSO trials held in
  camera" is technically answerable from `bnss:366` and this guard will
  abstain on it anyway. That is the intended trade-off: abstaining on a
  rare answerable phrasing is much cheaper than answering "what is the
  punishment under POCSO" from an unrelated BNS section.
- A question that mixes a covered subject with an uncovered one -- "the
  police officer wants money to register my FIR" -- abstains as
  corruption, losing the FIR-registration remedy that BNSS does cover.
  Same trade-off as the POCSO note above, and preferred to answering a
  bribery question from police-procedure law.
