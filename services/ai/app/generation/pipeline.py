"""Deterministic legal-answer pipeline -- no generative LLM.

Flow:
    question
        -> Risk/UPL check (app.safety.risk), deterministic rules
        -> topic-relevance guard (app.safety.topic_relevance)
        -> corpus-coverage guard (app.safety.corpus_coverage)
        -> app.retrieval.search (retrieval-only)
        -> confidence gate
        -> LegalAnswer built directly from the retrieved chunks

Standing project decision: the legal-answer path never uses a
generative LLM to produce an answer, to eliminate hallucination risk
(see docs/PROJECT_STATE.md). Every excerpt in a LegalAnswer is the
verbatim retrieved chunk text with its real citation -- nothing here
invents, paraphrases, or infers legal content. Multiple sources are
returned as multiple separate excerpts rather than merged into one
synthesized paragraph, so conflicting or overlapping evidence is
preserved by construction, not by special-case "conflict" logic.

# answer/abstain queries (see docs/RETRIEVAL_EVALUATION.md) and picking

    # 0.40 too (a separate, pre-existing paraphrase-calibration gap --
    # see docs/RETRIEVAL_EVALUATION.md). 0.42 does not fully separate

    # residual gap remains for "income tax slab" / "driving licence"
    # specifically, both ~0.45) -- closing that fully would cost real
    # recall (q20 sits at 0.4531) and likely needs a smarter signal
    # than a single global threshold, not a further blanket raise.

    # of the NORMALISED text (handle_legal_query retrieves on

    # any should-abstain query in the 362-row labelled pool reaches is
    # 0.399 -- the 0.42 floor was calibrated against raw-query scores.

    corpus-coverage guard -> retrieval -> deterministic answer.

    The safety policy (app.safety.risk.assess_query) runs first and
    decides one of four severities:

    ``harmful_request``
        A request to be shown how to destroy evidence, fabricate an
        alibi, interfere with a witness or evade an investigation.
        Refused outright; no retrieval happens.

    ``emergency``
        A life-threatening situation the person presents as real and
        current. Returns the relevant official helpline immediately, with
        no legal analysis in front of it -- a long explanation is the
        wrong response when someone is in danger. No retrieval happens.

    ``serious``
        A real legal matter affecting the person directly (a live
        accusation, an interrogation, an imminent arrest). Retrieval
        *does* run: the caution goes first, and the general law on the
        topic follows it behind the same confidence gate as any other
        query. What is withheld is personalised procedural coaching, not
        the text of the law -- someone facing an accusation is entitled
        to read the provision that governs it. The response is marked
        ``redirect_adviser`` with ``authority_guidance`` set, so the
        frontend leads with the caution rather than the excerpts.

    ``normal``
        Straight through to the guards below, unchanged.

    The topic-relevance guard runs next: a query matching a known
    out-of-domain subject (see app.safety.topic_relevance) is rejected
    before spending a retrieval call on it, since no score from that
    retrieval could be trusted as a real confidence signal for a topic
    this corpus was never meant to answer.

    The corpus-coverage guard runs third and handles the harder case the
    313-query evaluation exposed: a query that genuinely *is* a legal
    question in this service's subject area, but names an Act the corpus
    does not contain (POCSO, Motor Vehicles, matrimonial law, SC/ST
    Atrocities, RTI, Court Fees). Those share real legal vocabulary with
    real legal content, so they clear the dense-score floor and get
    answered confidently from the wrong Act -- see
    app.safety.corpus_coverage for the measured failures and the
    deliberately narrow scope. It runs before retrieval for the same
    reason the topic guard does, and returns a different message,
    because "try a government services portal" is the wrong advice for
    someone asking a real legal question.

    Citizen-language normalisation (app.query.normalize) runs last, after
    every gate has inspected the raw question, and rewrites only the text
    passed to retrieval -- appending statutory vocabulary so a question
    phrased in ordinary words can reach the provision it is about. It
    cannot influence safety, abstention, citations or the answer text.

    Nothing below changes retrieval, its thresholds, or the abstention
    logic. The safety layer only decides whether retrieval runs at all
    and how its result is framed.
