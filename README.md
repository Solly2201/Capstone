# Citizen Assistance Technology (CAT)

> Your rights. Your service. Your voice.

CAT is an India-focused citizen platform that answers legal questions
**only from official statutory text it has actually retrieved**, teaches
the same law in plain language, and gives citizens two civic workflows
(issue reports and petitions) with a simulated authority side.

CAT provides public awareness and information only. It is not legal
advice or legal representation. For real-world legal implications,
contact a qualified legal adviser. In an immediate emergency, call
**112**.

> **Status: FROZEN at `c24eda2` (M13).** M10-M13 are complete. This
> README describes the final system. `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md` is the
> authoritative current-state document and also carries the full
> milestone history.
>
> *Naming note:* the product is **CAT**. The npm workspace scope
> (`@cap/web`, `@cap/api`, `@cap/contracts`), the FastAPI service title
> and the seeded local accounts still use the project's earlier `cap`
> identifier. That is a code-level name only, deliberately left
> unchanged at the freeze.

## 1. Modules

| Module | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Learn** | 71 grounded learning articles across 12 categories, 216 quiz questions and 35 "What should I do?" FAQs. Every substantive paragraph cites the exact Article or section it was written against. Static, authored content -- the frontend never calls the AI service to render it. |
| **Legal Assistant** | `POST /api/legal/answer`. A citizen question runs through deterministic safety and coverage guards, then hybrid retrieval, then a confidence gate. The response is the **verbatim retrieved excerpt(s)** with real citations, or an abstention / clarification / redirect. Supports safe multi-turn follow-ups. |
| **Civic Reporting** | Citizen issue reports with optional photo (metadata stripped before storage), deterministic duplicate handling, and an authority workflow: declared transition table, server-controlled status history, staff-assigned priority with SLA deadlines, paginated and filtered authority queues. |
| **Petitions** | Petition lifecycle, one signature per account enforced by a unique compound index in MongoDB, public browse/detail with deterministic free-text search, and an authority moderation queue with a formal response panel. |

## 2. Technology stack

| Technology | What it actually does here |
| --- | --- |
| **React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind** | The citizen-facing UI (`apps/web`). React Router for routing, React Query for server state, React Hook Form + Zod for forms. |
| **Node.js 20 + Express** | The main application API (`services/api`): auth/RBAC, civic reports, petitions, media, and the proxy to the AI service. All business workflows live here. |
| **MongoDB + Mongoose** | Application/domain data -- users, reports, petitions, signatures, status history. Two correctness guarantees (one signature per citizen per petition, unique user email) are enforced by unique indexes, not by application code. |
| **Python 3.11 + FastAPI** | The AI / legal-retrieval service (`services/ai`): ingestion, index build, retrieval, the safety layer and deterministic answer assembly. It is a boundary, not a second application -- it owns no user data. |
| **rank-bm25** | Lexical retrieval. Carries the statutory-term half of a query (exact section titles, Act vocabulary). |
| **sentence-transformers** | Semantic retrieval. Encodes chunks and queries into 384-dim vectors; the production checkpoint is the fine-tuned `m12_run2` artifact (see section 5). Local only -- no paid API, no external inference call. |
| **Weighted Reciprocal Rank Fusion** | Combines the BM25 and dense **rankings** (not their scores, which are on incomparable scales) into one ordering. |
| **Deterministic safety / coverage rules** | Plain Python rule sets that decide whether retrieval runs at all and whether an answer may be shown. No classifier, no model, no generation. |
| **pypdf + pdfplumber** | Corpus ingestion from official PDFs, including a coordinate-based extractor for the two-column India Code gazette layout. |
| **Docker + Docker Compose** | Reproducible five-service local stack (web, api, ai, mongo, redis) with health checks and volume-persisted media / index / model data. |
| **GitHub Actions** | CI: typecheck, unit tests, production build, diff hygiene, the Python suite, and a MongoDB-service integration job. A separate scheduled workflow builds and smoke-tests the whole Compose stack. |

**Provisioned but not load-bearing, stated honestly.** Redis runs as a
Compose service and `REDIS_URL` is validated at boot, but no application
code connects to it -- rate limiting uses `express-rate-limit`'s
in-process store, which is correct for the single API instance this
project deploys and is recorded as a known limitation (section 10). A
Socket.IO server is mounted on the HTTP server and emits a readiness
handshake; no product feature uses real-time updates.

## 3. High-level architecture

```text
apps/web/            React + TypeScript citizen UI
       |
       v
services/api/        Node + Express application API  --->  MongoDB
       |                                                   local media storage
       v
services/ai/         Python + FastAPI AI service     --->  BM25 + dense index
                                                           over the legal corpus
packages/contracts/  Shared API/domain contracts (Zod)
```

The web app never talks to the AI service directly. Every legal call goes
`web -> /api/legal/answer (Node) -> /legal/answer (FastAPI)`, so the AI
boundary stays replaceable and traffic still passes the API's rate
limiting, logging and disclaimer handling.

Full detail -- including the civic and petition state machines -- is in
[docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## 4. Legal retrieval and safety architecture

The legal-answer pipeline, exactly as `handle_legal_query` implements it:

```text
USER QUESTION
   |
   v  Risk / UPL policy          harmful_request -> refuse; emergency -> helpline;
   |                             serious -> caution, retrieval still runs
   v  Context resolution         resolve a follow-up against the previous turn,
   |                             or ask for a restatement -- never guess
   v  Guard re-run               the combined text is client-supplied, so every
   |                             deterministic guard runs again; stricter wins
   v  Topic relevance            known non-legal subject -> abstain before retrieval
   |
   v  Corpus coverage            names an Act this corpus lacks -> abstain
   |
   v  Query normalization        append statutory vocabulary to the RETRIEVAL text only
   |
   v  BM25 + dense retrieval     top-50 candidate pool from each
   |
   v  Weighted RRF               k=5, dense weight 3.0, BM25 weight 1.0 -> top-5
   |
   v  Confidence / evidence gate hybrid floor 0.41 on the top hit's dense score
   |
   v  Citation verification      citations are structural manifest metadata, never text
   |
   v  DETERMINISTIC RESPONSE     the verbatim excerpt(s) + citations + disclaimer
```

If evidence is insufficient the pipeline **ABSTAINS** ("no verified
information found"), **CLARIFIES** (a follow-up it cannot resolve
safely), or **ROUTES** (an official helpline, a legal-aid service, or a
government-services portal). It never fills the gap.

### The 0% generative LLM invariant

**No generative LLM runs anywhere in the legal-answer pipeline. Not as a
generator, not as a reranker, not as a fallback, not as a classifier.**

An LLM-generation design (provider abstraction, a working Gemini
integration, citation validation over generated text) was fully built
early in the project and then deliberately discarded once weighed against
hallucination risk in a legal-information context. This is a standing
decision, not a temporary state.

What the invariant buys, concretely: there is no free text to fact-check,
because nothing writes any. Every user-visible legal sentence is either a
verbatim chunk of an official Act or one of a small set of hand-written,
test-pinned templates. Multiple or conflicting sources are returned as
separate excerpts with separate citations rather than merged into one
synthesized paragraph. `sentence-transformers` appears in the stack as an
*encoder*: it turns text into vectors for similarity search and emits no
words.

## 5. Final corpus and final model

**Corpus -- 10 official Acts, 1,827 chunks** (counted from
`services/ai/data/index/chunk_manifest.jsonl`):

| Source | Chunks | Source | Chunks |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
| Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 | 531 | Juvenile Justice Act, 2015 | 110 |
| Constitution of India | 366 | Consumer Protection Act, 2019 | 107 |
| Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023 | 356 | Information Technology Act, 2000 | 92 |
| Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam, 2023 | 170 | Protection of Women from DV Act, 2005 | 37 |
| | | Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987 | 32 |
| | | Right to Information Act, 2005 | 26 |

Coverage is deliberately partial and every gap is recorded -- see
[docs/LEGAL_SOURCES.md](docs/LEGAL_SOURCES.md). CAT does **not** claim
complete coverage of Indian law.

**Model -- `data/models/m12_run2`**, a fine-tune of
`sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (384-dim,
MultipleNegativesRankingLoss, 4 epochs, batch 16, lr 2e-5, seed 42,
1682/340 train/val triplets). `model.safetensors` SHA-256
`d61d077b...0ce801`. It is a **gitignored build artifact**, reproduced by
the seeded pipeline in `services/ai/finetune/` -- never committed. See
section 12 for how it is loaded.

**Retrieval configuration:** hybrid mode, top-50 candidate pool per
method, weighted RRF (k=5, dense 3.0 / BM25 1.0), top_k 5, confidence
floor 0.41 evaluated against the top hit's dense score.

## 6. Final production evaluation

These are the deployed system's benchmark numbers on the path production
actually runs (`run_eval.py --production-path --mode hybrid`). The
baseline is the same pipeline with only the embedding model reverted.
Every candidate number was reproduced twice, byte-identically.

| Metric | Citizen 281 | Control 46 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Recall@5 | 0.7448 -> **0.9554** | 0.8623 -> **0.9674** |
| MRR | 0.5656 -> **0.8800** | 0.7341 -> **0.9246** |
| nDCG@5 | 0.6040 -> **0.8984** | 0.7476 -> **0.9261** |
| Top-1 citation correctness | 0.4448 -> **0.8185** | 0.6522 -> **0.8913** |
| Abstention accuracy | 0.8562 -> **0.9233** | 0.9796 -> 0.9592 |
| False accepts | 0 -> **0** | 0 -> **0** |
| Wrong-Act top-1 | 43 -> **19** | 3 -> 3 (no new) |
| Hard-negative recall | **29/29** | -- |

**The 281- and 46-query sets contain queries the model was trained on.
They are the deployed system's benchmark, not generalisation evidence.**

The generalisation claim is the separate **held-out-only** evaluation,
restricted to ids in `finetune/data/test.jsonl` that were never trained
or selected on -- citizen 41 queries: recall@5 0.7634 -> **0.8732**, MRR
0.5687 -> 0.7122, top-1 0.4634 -> 0.6098, abstention 0.7561 -> 0.8293,
zero false accepts. Control 9 queries: MRR 0.7259 -> 0.8000, top-1 0.6667
-> 0.7778.

`docs/RETRIEVAL_EVALUATION.md` carries the full method, the per-category
splits, the individually inspected regressions, and the experiments that
were measured and **rejected** (cross-encoder reranking, a
citizen-language concept index, a generic spelling corrector, an
agreement-branch gate).

## 7. Context / follow-up capability

The Legal Assistant resolves a safe follow-up ("what if I'm a minor?") by
**deterministic composition** with the previous question -- no model, no
LLM. The combined text is shown back to the citizen verbatim, so nothing
is interpreted invisibly, and every safety guard re-runs against it with
the stricter outcome winning, so context can never carry a query past a
decision the first turn already lost. A follow-up that cannot be resolved
safely asks for a restatement instead of guessing.

Measured on a 40-row corpus-verified benchmark: condition follow-ups
19/21 with context versus 6/21 fragment-only, ambiguous 4/4, no-context
4/4, guarded 6/6, not-emergency 2/2, standalone override 2/3.

## 8. Civic and petition workflows

- **Civic:** report -> (optional photo, metadata stripped) -> deterministic duplicate handling -> authority review through a declared transition table -> server-controlled status history with actor names -> staff priority and SLA deadline -> citizen-visible outcome. Duplicate handling is an exact-resubmission SHA-256 fingerprint enforced by a unique sparse index, plus a nearby-recent-same-category *warning the citizen can override* -- never a refusal of an independent report.
- **Petitions:** create -> moderation -> publish -> sign (one signature per account, unique compound index) -> authority formal response. An ADMIN signature recount implements the documented count-drift recovery.
- **Legal to Learn link:** an answer surfaces the Learn articles and FAQs grounded in the very provisions it cited, via an exact `sourceId:unitNumber` metadata join -- no similarity model, no invented relationship.

Not built, by decision: civic vision/ML, automatic categorisation or
priority prediction, the petition recommendation agent, notifications,
analytics.

## 9. Testing and CI

All verified at the freeze:

| Suite | Result | Command |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Python (AI service) | **369 passed** | `cd services/ai && python -m pytest tests/ -q` |
| API unit (vitest) | **318 passed** | `npm test -w @cap/api` |
| Web unit (vitest) | **278 passed** | `npm test -w @cap/web` |
| Monorepo typecheck | clean | `npm run typecheck` |
| Production build | clean | `npm run build` |
| DB integration (real MongoDB) | CI job | `npm run test:integration -w @cap/api` |
| Compose stack smoke | scheduled CI job | `.github/workflows/integration.yml` |

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs typecheck, tests, build and `git diff
--check`, plus the MongoDB integration job and the Python suite, on every
push and pull request. The retrieval evaluation is deliberately **not**
in CI: it is an offline research workflow, not a per-commit check.

The Compose-stack workflow builds all images and asserts the live legal
path end to end (an in-domain question returns cited excerpts with a
disclaimer; an out-of-domain question abstains).

## 10. Known limitations

- **Coverage is partial.** 10 Acts. POCSO, motor vehicles, matrimonial law, SC/ST atrocities and court fees/CPC are not ingested and are named by the corpus-coverage guard, which abstains on them *before retrieval* rather than answering from an adjacent Act. Labour/workplace, tenancy, data protection, stamp duty and arbitration are also not ingested but carry no guard rule: a probe confirmed the confidence gate already abstains on them correctly, and the guard deliberately carries one entry per demonstrated failure rather than a list of every Indian Act. See `docs/LEGAL_SOURCES.md`.
- **RTI is ingested from a pre-2019 copy.** ss.13, 16 and 27 (replaced by the RTI (Amendment) Act 2019) are excluded rather than served as current law; s.25 is excluded for measured retrieval harm; no RTI fee figure is stated anywhere, because the Act leaves it to rules that are not ingested.
- **Four sections across two sources** (BNS 217/255, JJ Act 61/86) merge into the preceding chunk because of a source-PDF layout quirk -- a citation-accuracy defect for those four, not content loss.
- **One residual retrieval preference:** "can an officer be penalized for not providing information" ranks `it_act:44` above `rti:20`. Both are genuine penalty-for-not-furnishing-information provisions and the query names no Act; the RTI section stays in the window the citizen sees.
- **Rate limiting is in-process** (single API instance). `REDIS_URL` is validated but nothing connects to Redis.
- **Media is served from disk**, not streamed; email verification requires a configured `SMTP_URL` (production self-registration answers 503 rather than issuing a challenge nobody can receive).
- **English only.** The service boundary keeps multilingual expansion isolated, but nothing multilingual is built.

Every gap, including the ones closed and why, is enumerated in
`docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`.

## 11. Local development

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 20+ and npm 10+, Docker Desktop, Python 3.11+.

```bash
# 1. JavaScript
npm install
docker compose up -d mongo redis
npm run dev:api            # http://localhost:4000
npm run dev:web            # http://localhost:5173
npm run seed -w @cap/api   # demo accounts; refuses to run under NODE_ENV=production

# 2. AI service (from services/ai/)
pip install -r requirements-full.txt        # hybrid; requirements.txt alone = BM25-only
export DENSE_EMBEDDING_MODEL=data/models/m12_run2
python scripts/ingest_corpus.py             # builds bm25.pkl + dense_vectors.npy
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

Or bring the whole stack up with `docker compose up`.

**Adding or updating a source:** drop `raw.txt` (or `raw.pdf`, extracted
automatically on first ingest) into
`services/ai/data/legal-corpus/<source_id>/`, register `source_id` in
`app/ingestion/sources.py`'s `APPROVED_SOURCES` if it is new, and re-run
`python scripts/ingest_corpus.py`. No retrieval code changes.

**Re-running the evaluation** after any corpus, retrieval or model
change:

```bash
cd services/ai
python eval/run_eval.py --production-path --mode hybrid           # control 46
python eval/run_eval.py --production-path --mode hybrid --human   # citizen 281
python eval/run_context_eval.py                                   # 40-row follow-up benchmark
```

**Optional environment variables:** `RETRIEVAL_MODE`
(`bm25` | `dense` | `hybrid`, default auto) and `LEGAL_CHAT_MIN_SCORE`
(overrides the confidence floor for the active mode; per-mode defaults
live in `services/ai/app/generation/pipeline.py`).

## 12. Deployment

The AI service loads its embedding model from **`DENSE_EMBEDDING_MODEL`**,
whose production value is `data/models/m12_run2` -- a
*service-root-relative* path. `embeddings.resolve_model_path()` resolves
it against the service root at load time only, so the same
`index_manifest.json` works on the host (any CWD) and inside the
container, where `docker-compose.yml` mounts `./services/ai/data` at
`/app/data` read-only.

**The system does not depend on an accidental untracked artifact.** The
model directory is gitignored under the same policy as the index: both
are build artifacts, both are reproduced deterministically by seeded
scripts in this repository (`finetune/train.py` and
`scripts/ingest_corpus.py`), and the exact expected hashes are recorded
in `docs/RETRIEVAL_EVALUATION.md`'s M13 section. A ~90 MB model binary is
deliberately not committed.

At query time the service always follows what `index_manifest.json`
records -- the model that actually built the mounted index -- so a
running service can never encode queries with a different model than the
index was built with. Changing the model is therefore: set the variable,
re-run `scripts/ingest_corpus.py`, restart. **No image rebuild is
required** for a model or index change, because `data/` is mounted rather
than baked in.

Required for a real deployment: a generated `JWT_SECRET` (the API refuses
to boot in production with the placeholder), a non-wildcard `WEB_ORIGIN`,
`MONGODB_URI`, `AI_SERVICE_URL`, and `SMTP_URL` if self-registration is
enabled. See `.env.example`.

## Local demo accounts

**Development only.** Created by `npm run seed -w @cap/api`, which
refuses to run when `NODE_ENV=production`. All are pre-verified and have
accepted the current legal-information disclaimer. Never seed them into a
deployed environment.

| Role | Email | Password |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Admin | `admin@cap.local` | `CAPAdmin!2026` |
| Authority | `authority@cap.local` | `CAPAuthority!2026` |
| Citizen | `shreshtha.bindal26@nmims.in` | `CapStone@22!` |
| Citizen (test) | `user@test.com` | `CapStone@22!` |

Replace these credentials and the JWT secret before any non-local
deployment. The API enforces the second half of that: under
`NODE_ENV=production` it refuses to start while `JWT_SECRET` is still the
development placeholder.

## Safety and source policy

- The Legal Assistant answers only from retrieved, approved official sources, and attaches citations with a verification date.
- If evidence is missing, relevance is low, or the question seeks personalised legal advice, it abstains and redirects to appropriate official support.
- High-risk situations (active crime, violence, harassment, domestic violence, child safety, self-harm, medical emergency, cyber financial fraud) never reach retrieval; only official national numbers (112, 181, 1098, 1930) are named, as fixed configuration data.
- Only Admins may access retained unblurred source images. User-facing and Authority views use privacy-masked derivatives.
